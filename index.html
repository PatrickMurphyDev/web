                        <h2>What are ALPRs?</h2>
                        <p>Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) are AI-powered cameras that capture and analyze
                            images of all passing vehicles, storing details like your car's location, date, and time.
                            They also capture your car's make, model, color, and identifying features such as dents,
                            roof racks, and bumper stickers, often turning these into searchable data points. These
                            cameras collect data on millions of vehicles—regardless of whether the driver is suspected
                            of a crime. While these systems can be useful for tracking stolen cars or wanted
                            individuals, they are mostly used to track the movements of innocent people.</p>

                        <p>ALPRs are a serious risk to your privacy and civil liberties. These systems continuously
                            record people's movements, often without a warrant, probable cause, or even reasonable
                            suspicion. Your driving history is rarely confined to the town or city where the cameras are
                            installed. It's typically shared with thousands of other agencies nationwide (secretly).
                            Once the data is out of your community, you have no control over how it's used or what rules
                            apply. And once this kind of tracking infrastructure exists, there are no guarantees it will
                            only be used against criminals.</p>
